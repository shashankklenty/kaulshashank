### Hello ðŸ‘‹

I'm Shashank and I'm obsessed with building tools and products that make our jobs easier. 

I love collaborating with people and I'm really easy to approach. If its a dev tool or a product that automates something then I'm all :ear:. I also love reading research on cyber security and hope that I will one day be able to make an impact in the security community.

Almost forgot, I love playing :video_game:. MMO's with amazing lore are my ultimate weakness. :grimacing:
